Make your real estate site shine with beautiful design, stunning photos, and proven lead generation tools.**IDX** is an industry standard that enables a real estate professional to display all of an MLS's property listings on their website, provided they in turn permit other MLS members to display their listings. To qualify for IDX and display an MLS's listings you must be a member of that MLS and be approved for IDX by the MLS.Several different types of property search pages, listing gallery pages, and contact pages can be added to your site's navigation menu. You can also take advantage of shortcodes to embed listings within the content of any page or post on your site. A collection of widgets are additionally provided to add quick search, lead capture, and property listings to your sidebar widget areas.[View our demo site](http://www.optima-express-demo.com/ "view Optima Express IDX plugin demo") to see the plugin's full range of features.**An iHomefinder Optima Express account is required to activate this plugin.

You can enter a registration code for an existing paid account, create a free trial account with sample IDX listings, or purchase a new paid account for your MLS by accessing the "Registration" section of the plugin menu within the WordPress Dashboard.= Will my site get SEO credit for IDX listings? =Yes. The Optima Express IDX plugin **doesn't "frame" property listing data** into your WordPress site. Instead, property listings appear directly under your domain, ensuring that your site gets full SEO credit.= Will Optima Express work with a mobile device? =When paired with a responsive theme, Optima Express is optimized for viewing from any device, including smartphones. For non-responsive theme users, Optima Express includes a full mobile IDX site that will work on any browser-enabled mobile device, such as iPhones and Android smartphones. We can provide you with a mobile re-direct plugin that will automatically send mobile devices to your mobile IDX site.= What kind of lead capture tools are provided? =Lead generation tools include listing-page lead generation (Schedule a Showing, Request Info, Save Property), multiple styles of forced visitor registration, and automated daily email alerts, through which prospective homebuyers are automatically emailed listings that match their provided search criteria.= Can anyone get an account? =Only real estate professionals who are active members of a [supported MLS](http://www.ihomefinder.com/mls-coverage/ "supported MLSs providing IDX listings") can sign-up for a paid account with live MLS listings. If you you don't see your MLS listed, please [contact us](http://www.ihomefinder.com/forms/contact-us/ "contact us for information about IDX MLS coverage") about adding IDX service for your MLS.= Do I have to contact my MLS when signing up for an account? =Our automated system will send you any necessary IDX approval paperwork when you request an account. When completed and returned to us, we will manage your IDX paperwork through the MLS approval process.= Where can I find out if my MLS is supported? =Please refer to our current list of [supported MLSs](http://www.ihomefinder.com/mls-coverage/ "supported MLSs providing IDX listings").= Does the plugin provide access to multiple MLSs? =The plugin will provide IDX data for the MLS(s) you request when you sign up for your Optima Express account. If you belong to more than one MLS, you can request service for additional MLSs at an additional cost.= How long does it take to get MLS approval? =Depending upon your MLS, approval can take anywhere from less than a business day to a week. While you're waiting for MLS approval you can test the Optima Express IDX plugin on your site with our demo IDX listing data.= How do I access my IDX account's back-end Control Panel? =Go to the "IDX Control Panel" section of the plugin menu within the WordPress Dashboard. From there you can manage IDX property search settings, manage your own listings, and manage your leads.= How frequently is the data updated? =Our IDX property listing data is updated every two hours for most MLSs, and as frequently as every 15 minutes for some MLSs.= Where can I learn more about the features and pricing? =Please visit the [Optima Express IDX plugin page](http://www.ihomefinder.com/product/optima-express/ "Optima Express IDX plugin information") on the iHomefinder website for the latest news and information.= Some parts of the IDX display look a little distorted. How can this be fixed? =There's most likely a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) conflict between styles defined by your theme and styles defined by the plugin. You can use a tool like Firebug to identify the problematic styles. Then, go to the Optima Express > Configuration section of the plugin and enter overrides for the problematic styles. Or, [contact our support team](http://www.ihomefinder.com/support/ "contact our support team") for assistance.== Screenshots ==1.
