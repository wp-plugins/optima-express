= OPTIMA EXPRESS PACKAGES =

= Optima Express  =

The Optima Express base package provides MLS/IDX search, results, and property details pages directly within your WordPress site. This package also includes a Featured Properties page and a Featured Properties Gallery widget that can be placed on any page within your site. Other features are outlined below.

= Optima Express Pro =

The Optima Express Pro package includes all the features of the Optima Express base package plus daily Email Alerts, Top Picks pages & widgets, Saved Searches, Listing Galleries for Posts & Pages, User Registration prompts and a complete Mobile IDX website.

= OPTIMA EXPRESS PAGES =

The Optima Express plugin creates links to IDX pages that can be added to your WordPress navigation menu and other portions of your site.

The following IDX pages are provided:

= Property Search =

Site visitors can search for properties by price, city, baths, and bedrooms. (see an example at <a href="http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/homes-for-sale-search/">http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/homes-for-sale-search/</a>)

= Advanced Property Search =

Site visitors can search for properties using advanced search criteria, which varies by MLS. (see an example at http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/)

= Featured Properties =

The Featured Properties page displays your current listings, or listings from your office if you currently have no listings of your own. (see an example at <a href="http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/homes-for-sale-featured/">http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/homes-for-sale-featured/</a>)

= Top Picks =

Top Picks pages display a list of saved searches such as listings in your market area, homes with water views, distressed properties, and so on. (see an example at <a href="http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/homes-for-sale-toppicks/">http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/homes-for-sale-toppicks/</a>)

= Listing Gallery Shortcodes =



Insert listings into your Pages and Posts easily. A simple interface allows you to add Featured Listings, Top Picks or Search results directly into your Page or Post using a shortcode. (see an example at <a href="http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/listing-galleries/">http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/listing-galleries/</a>) 


= Email Alerts =



Your site visitors can sign-up for daily email alerts containing listings that match their desired search criteria. Email alert sign-ups and activity are tracked in your iHomefinder Control Panel. (see an example at <a href="http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/email-alerts/">http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/email-alerts/</a>)



= Property Organizer  =



The Property Organizer page enables prospective homebuyers to save properties and searches of interest. Saved searches trigger daily email alerts containing properties that match a consumer's desired search criteria. Property organizer sign-ups and activity are tracked in your iHomefinder Control Panel. You can also add to or modify the listings and searches saved in any consumer's Property Organizer. (see an example at <a href="http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/property-organizer-login/">http://blog.anyhomesrealty.com/property-organizer-login/</a>)



= WIDGETS =



You can enhance your WordPress site with a selection of Quicksearch and Property Gallery widgets. Easily configure these widgets to display only on certain Optima Express pages. Your WordPress theme will determine where the widgets appear on your other WordPress pages. 



= Quick Search Widgets  =



Add property search to any page by dragging the Quicksearch widget to the page's sidebar.

Add a free text search to the body of a page using the shortcode [optima_express_quick_search].


= Featured Properties Gallery Widget =



Display your Featured Properties in an attractive WordPress widget on any page of your site.



= Top Picks Gallery Widget =



Display the results of a saved search created in your iHomefinder Control Panel. Showcase the type of listings you specialize in, such as REOs, condos, or waterfront properties. Or, highlight the different neighborhoods and subdivisions that you cover. (Optima Express Pro only)



= Saved Search Gallery Widget  =



Similar to a Top Picks Gallery Widget, except you can define the saved search using basic search parameters within your WordPress Dashboard rather than the iHomefinder Control Panel. (Optima Express Pro only)



= Saved Search Link Widget  =



Add links to pages containing your saved searches. For example, add a link to all active listings in every neighbor of your territory. This widget is configured in the same way as the Saved Search Gallery Widget, but instead of showing a gallery of listings, it displays a link to a saved search results page. (Optima Express Pro only)



= WORDPRESS THEMES =



A WordPress Theme defines the layout and design of your WordPress website. Optima Express is known to be compatible with the following themes:



* StudioPress AgentPress

* Twenty Ten

* Twenty Eleven

* Headway 2012



Technical note: Other WordPress themes are likely to display Optima Express content correctly provided that the theme is properly coded with jQuery set to run in 'no conflict' mode. Please contact iHomefinder support (<a href="mailto:support@ihomefinder.com">support@ihomefinder.com</a>) for assistance with specific themes.



Optima Express pages are 620 pixels wide, and widgets are 180 pixels wide.



= CONTROL PANEL =



Your Optima Express pages display IDX pages as set-up in your iHomefinder Control Panel. Note that this is separate from your WordPress Dashboard. Use the Control Panel to configure property search settings, Top Picks, Featured Properties, branding for Email Alerts, lead management and much more. The Help system, located in the top right corner of the Control Panel, provides detailed instructions for all account features.
