Optima Express pages are 620 pixels wide, and widgets are 180 pixels wide.


= CONTROL PANEL =

Your Optima Express pages display IDX pages as set-up in your iHomefinder Control Panel. Note that this is separate from your WordPress Dashboard. Use the Control Panel to configure property search settings, Top Picks, Featured Properties, branding for Email Alerts, lead management and much more. Broker clients can manage Agents and Offices, as well as leads and lead routing, within the Control Panel. The Help system, located in the top right corner of the Control Panel, provides detailed instructions for all account features.
